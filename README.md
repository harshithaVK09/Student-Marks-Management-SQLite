## Description

This project is a **Student Marks Management and Report Card Generation System** developed using the **Python Flask framework** and **SQLite database** with a simple web interface.

The system allows an **Admin** to log in and perform the following operations:
- Add new student records  
- Enter and update subject marks  
- View all stored student records  
- Search students by name  
- Edit and delete student details  
- Generate and download student report cards in **PDF format**

The frontend is built using **HTML and CSS**, while the backend logic is handled using **Flask (Python)**.  
All student data is stored in a **SQLite database**, making the system lightweight and easy to deploy locally.

This project helps in managing student academic records efficiently and automates the process of report card generation, reducing manual work and errors.

It was developed as part of my **MCA academic project**.
